# HonsResearchProject
Software testing is an extremely costly part of any software development process but is needed in an attempt to find and remove all the errors in a system. This is especially true for safety-critical systems. In this project a genetic algorithm will be used to generate input data to perform black box testing on a safety- critical system in a guided search manner. A genetic algorithm is a population based stochastic algorithm that is based on Darwinâ€™s theory of "survival of the fittest" to find a candidate solution for a given problem. The project will also combine Temporal Logic formulas as part of the fitness function for the genetic algorithm, as well as also create a scaleable configurable safety-critical system that the system can be evaluated on. Temporal Logic formulas are first order logic formulas that take into consideration the effect of time on the outcome of the formula. The proposed automated testing system will then be compared to traditional testing methods to evaluate the performance of the newly proposed approach.
